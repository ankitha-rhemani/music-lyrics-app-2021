Two Android apps built using Kodular, reaching 74.5K+ installs, maintained for 2 years and later responsibly sunset due to copyright considerations.

# Overview
This project represents a significant phase of my early app-development journey. Built in 2021, these fan-made music & lyrics apps were created when I was both a K-pop enthusiast and an app-building enthusiast, constantly looking for opportunities to learn by building and publishing real products.
I developed and published two separate Android applications—one for BTS and one for Blackpink—and actively maintained them until the end of 2022.
Together, the apps reached 74.5K+ total installs on the Google Play Store.

# Apps Included
1. BTS Music & Lyrics App — 48.7K installs
2. Blackpink Music & Lyrics App — 26.1K installs
Combined installs: 74.5K+

# Project Closure
In 2023, I decided to move toward building original products and avoid continued use of copyrighted material.

Before removing both apps from the Play Store:
Users were notified via OneSignal push notifications
Apps were responsibly removed

This project reflects my transition from experimental fan-based apps to more original, long-term product development.
This project is showcased for learning, scale, and maintenance experience, not for redistribution.
